//conditionals assignment

//TODO idea!!!

//2 arithmetic operators + -,
//2 conditional statements with an if statement, and not validating prompts
//1 ternary conditional statement
//1 logical operator &&, ||, !
//3 prompts w/ validations


//5+ commits
//concatenation of strings and variables

//values in multi-lines comment

//compress into zip file called, Birchard_Eric_Conditionals_Assignment
//upload to FSO
//check to make sure code is in repository, and zip file

/*

//Conditional logic
//If else

//if the kid is over 48 inches in height

var kidHeight = 48;
var minHeight = 48;
var sneakerLift = 2;

//if the child is old enough, print to the console "you can ride!"

if(kidHeight > minHeight){
    //code performed if condition is true
    console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
    //code performed if condition is false
} else{
    console.log("Sorry kid you got some growing to do first!");

}



//Conditional logic
//else if for three blocks of code always has a condition attached

//if the kid is over 48 inches in height

var kidHeight = 48;
var minHeight = 48;
var wParentHeight = 45;

//if the child is old enough, print to the console "you can ride!"

    //you can ride!
    console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
    //you can ride with a parent present
    //else should never have a conditions attached

Relational operators > < >= <= compare to result in true or false
Equality operators
    Equal           =       overwrites
    Equality        ==      or the same as      6 == "6" is TRUE
    Strict Equality ===     same value and type 6 === "6" is FALSE faster
    Inequality      !=      or not equal to     a != b      is TRUE


 Logical operators (boolean or comparisons only)
    And                 &&
    Or                  ||
    Exclusive Or (OXR)  ^
    Not                 !

    TRUE    TRUE        &&  ||
    TRUE    FALSE           ||
    FALSE   TRUE            ||  !
    FALSE   FALSE               !

a === b && b === c



//Conditional Logic - Logical operators AND if our paycheck is over 300

var budget = 100;
var iPhonePrice = 199.99
var wonLottery = true;

//if the price of the phone is less than our budget

if(iPhonePrice < budget || wonLottery === true){
    console.log("We can buy the phone!");
}else{
    console.log("No phone for you!!");
}


//Ternaries requires 3 components

if(condition){
    do if true;
}else{
    do if false;
}

//Ternary version

(condition) ? do if true : do if false;


var gpa = 48;

//if the gpa is over the min 2.0 score, the student can graduate

}

var gpa = 48;

(gpa > 2.0) ? console.log("You can graduate!") : console.log("GPA is too low!");


var age =6;
var book;

//if the child is under 10, they get Green Eggs and Ham, otherwise they get the The Time machine
